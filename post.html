                    <p>The bigger number is always better right? but when it come to graphics card this isn’t always the case.the most dominant players in this industry is Nividia and AMD and Intel<br><br>All the others either stopped make graphics card,
                        went bankrupt (like 3Dfx) or were acquired by larger companies.</p>
                    <p>Today, only Nvidia and AMD make graphics card.at the time of wrighting this artical Intel is working on intel Xe graphics card so we didn't know nothing about it.</p>
                    <p>Generally, larger numbers denote better performance.&nbsp;Within a generation of graphics cards this is easy to understand.&nbsp;It is obvious that the RTX 2080 will perform better than the RTX 2070, and that the RX 5700 is faster
                        than the RX5600.&nbsp;But how does the GTX 1080 compare to the RTX 2080?<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"><strong>NVIDIA Gpu's&nbsp;</strong></h2>
                    <p>NVIDIA’s card names look like this:<br>GTX 1030, GTX 1050, GTX 1050Ti, GTX 1060, GTX 1070, GTX 1070Ti, GTX 1080 , GTX 1080Ti,. All of these are part of the "<strong>GeForce 10 series</strong>", RTX 2060,RTX 2060 Super,RTX 2070,RTX
                        2070 Super,RTX 2080,RTX 2080Ti,RTX 2080 Super. And these are part of the "<strong>GeForce RTX 20 Series</strong>" since they start with RTX as prefix these RTX poweres cards has ray-tracing</p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Gefource-cards.jpg?h=93e36a0741c0a983d682f0e08e0c2d9b">
                    <p>So what does that all mean? Well, lets start with GTX or RTX. GTX is their “standard” line of cards, whereas RTX cards have dedicated hardware onboard to run their “RTX” suite of features in games – namely RayTraced lighting, but also
                        a form of anti-aliasing they call DLSS. For the average person, these features boil down to slightly nicer lighting, or reflections, or shadows in supported games, and depending on the game, a slightly crisper image or better FPS
                        while not drastically losing image quality. </p>
                    <p>When it come to the numbers the first two digits tell what genertion that card belongs to like'16'in '1660' or '20' in '2060' and the last two digits tell you what version of the card it is from the generation always higher the better,so
                        a “1650” is lower end than a “1660”, and “2060” is lower end than a “2080”. </p>
                    <p>And after the four digit numbers there will be some suffixes like 'TI' or'SUPER' waht those suffixes mean?<br><br>well simple TI is a way for adding more level for the specific card giving like giving some extra little power after
                        the main production of the card so a “1070TI” is better than a “1070” but not as good as a “1080”</p>
                    <p>Super is a brand new name they’ve added to again add more product segments, it’s basically a slightly improved version of the original, so the RTX 2070 Super is better than a standard RTX 2070. And to confuse you more, some of the
                        original ones have now been discontinued, those being the RTX 2070 and 2080 non-Super variants.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">AMD Gpu's</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to AMD,they have change thier names of GPU quite a lot but when comparing to NVIDIA,AMD priced there line of cards lower,so that large portion of gaming community like AMD<br>AMD’s card names look like this:RX 5500,RX
                        5500XT,RX 5600,RX 5600XT,RX 5700,RX 5700XT,Radeon VII ,RX 590,RX 580 ext..</p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/RX5700XT.jpg?h=9415e693149ba969ca0c7568337a08e7"></a><span class="caption text-muted">RX5700XT the new latest AMd's powerfull card</span>
                    <p>like NVIDIA with the first number telling you the generation, and the second telling you the model number, so the RX 5700 is a better card than an RX 5500 – and XT, much like TI, tells you it’s a faster card than the “non XT” version.
                        </p>
                    <p>Their old product name, “VEGA” was the codename for their architecture, and so is very likely dead now, but since you can still buy the cards, I’ll explain that anyway. You’ve got 3 cards here, starting at the highest end, the Vega
                        7, then Vega 64 and Vega 56. The name jumps around here because the vega 7 is based on a 7nm architecture, hence the name, whereas the older vega cards had their names based on how many compute units each card had. </p>
                    <p>where as RX 590 is old card and it also follows the same naming scheme to but in a slight different way where the “5” in “590” is the generation, and “90” is the model number, with the higher the better.but still there no significant
                        diffrence bettween RX 590 and RX 580 the only diffrence is RX 590 is 12nm FinFER as opposed to the RX 580's 14nm one</p>
